# Conjector

Simple library for managing single application state as map of objects (including maps) with dependency injection,
initialize/shutdown behavior. It is intended to be used to manage single global state structure that can be used as
basis for maintainable multi-component applications.

Library has layered design. The `process` layer contains abstract dependency processing and generalized state structure 
construction in dependency defined order. On top of that there is `appstate` which implements application state managent
as it is used by application itself. The `component` layer implements convenience macro that allows for defining 
components for `appstate` in a more convenient way (kind of DSL).
