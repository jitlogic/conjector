# Conjector

Simple library for managing single application state as map of objects (including maps) with dependency injection,
initialize/shutdown behavior. It is intended to be used to manage single global state structure that can be used as
basis for maintainable multi-component applications. 

Library has layered design. The `process` layer contains abstract dependency processing and generalized state structure 
construction in dependency defined order. On top of that there is `appstate` which implements application state managent
as it is used by application itself. The `component` layer implements convenience macro that allows for defining 
components for `appstate` in a more convenient way (kind of DSL).


## Basic state processing

Basic, abstract state processing is implemented in `io.resonant.conjector.process` namespace. It is built around idea
that system state data is tree-like structure (recursive map), where each component can be accessed using path which
is a sequence of keys into subsequent maps, for example:

```
{:foo <foo-data>
 :bar {
   :baz <baz-data>
   :bag {
     :a <bag-a-data>
     :b <bag-b-data>
   }
 }
}
``` 

Various object in above structure are addressed by paths, for example: `[:foo]`, `[:bar :baz]`, `[:bar :bag :a]`.

Function `process` implements generalized construction of such structure based on processing logic, system definition 
and input data:

```
(def process {:keys [proc-node? proc-fn proc-order requires before] :as proc-args} sysdef {:keys [d1,d2,...]:as data} ...)
```

Processing is performed in dependency order, so each processing steps sees results of all previous steps and gets 
guaranteed results of all steps declared as dependencies.

Argument `sysdef` is system definition and contains hierachical map that reflects application state and contains
constant definitions needed to construct output structure using functions from `proc-args`. 

Argument `data` contains additional (optional) data items - as there can be multiple sources of data, it is a map
containing maps that reflect structure from `sysdef`.

Argument `proc-args` contains map of functions implementing processing general rules:

* `:proc-node?` - accepts node returns true if given node qualifies for processing;

* `:proc-fn` - processing function (see below)

* `:proc-order` - accepts paths list processing order, either `identity` or `reverse`

* `:requires` - dependencies (list of paths);

* `:before` - reverse dependencies (list of paths);

While processing, all tree nodes from `sysdef` for which `:proc-node?` returns true, are ordered according to `:requires`
and `:before` results and `:proc-order` (reverse or normal). Then for each such node `:proc-fn` function is called with 
results from all previous steps, current node and parts of input data.

Function `:proc-fn` returns part of state and accepts map with following keys:

* `:all-state` - full state structure (built so far);

* `:path` - path to element currently processed;

* `:state` - local state structure (built so far - `(get-in all-state path)`);

* `:pdef` - processing definition (`(get-in sysdefs path)`);

* `:all-data` - all input data

* `:data` - local input data (`get-in all-data path`)

Function result is merged with `all-state` using `path` (`(assoc-in all-state path process-result)`)

## Application state

On top of processing layer, this one implements application components with init and shutdown logic. 
See `io.resonant.conjector.appstate` namespace. 

Sysdefs nodes have following properties:

* `:init` (mandatory) - init/reload function (see below);

* `:shutdown` (optional) - shutdown function

* `:requires`, `:before` - dependencies and reverse dependencies (as vectors of paths);

Init function can be used for in both initialization and reinitialization scenarios. Function returns part of application
state and accepts a map with following keys:

* `:config` - component configuration;

* `:old-config` - old configuration;

* `:state` - application state (built so far) - note that this is only part related to currently processed component;

* `:old-state` - old application state;

* `:system` - full application state;

There are two public function sin this module:

* `(init sysdef config old-state old-config)` - builds new application state, initializes/reinitializes all components;

* `(shutdown sysdef config old-state)` - shuts down all components (eg. closes all database connections etc.);


## Creating components

There are two macros useful for declaring components: `component` and `defcomponent`. These are convenience macros
that allow defining application components in a more compact way. Macro offers convenient destructring of application
state and automatic wrapping code block as init function. Example definition:

```clojure
(component [{{:keys [initial]} :config, {:keys [counter increment]} :state}]
  :before [[:baz]], :requires [[:bag]]
  :config-schema {:initial s/Num}
  :state-schema {:counter s/Atom, :increment s/Any}
  (let [counter (or counter (atom initial))]
    {:counter counter,
     :increment (fn [] (swap! counter inc))}))
```

Note that init function will get single map wit arguments described in previous section that will be destructured according
to declaration from first line of above example. All keyworded arguments are optional, init code is the only mandatory 
thing in above declaration.
